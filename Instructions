This repository contains the solution to the first Course Project for the Johns Hopkins Exploratory Data Analysis.
The solution required to include four files (plot1.R, plot2.R, etc.) wich includes the R code to generate the graphics, and the 
four graphics files as (plot1.png, plot2.png, etc.)
You can test your solution in your own environment, for that you most replace the working directory to your own, that is in the sixth
line of each of the four R files.

Also you have to download the sour data from 

* <b>Dataset</b>: <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip">Electric power consumption</a> [20Mb]


If you want to know more about the instructions that generate this solution please refer to the README.md file
